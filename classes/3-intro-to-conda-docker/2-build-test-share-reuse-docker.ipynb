    "# Combining dependency management with conda and Docker\n",
    "  We can combine an environment.yml file with a Dockerfile and an install.R\n",
    "  script to cover many container use cases for Bioinformatics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "The [`nf-core`](https://github.com/nf-core) community has established a highly practical convention for creating  docker containers by re-using an **environment.yml** file that can be also used for installing dependencies in an interactive session.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 3 main ingredients to this Dockerfile formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The **environment.yml** file\n",
    "2. The template **Dockerfile**\n",
    "3. An **install.R** file _**\\(optional\\)**_ \n",
    "\n",
    " The latter is only optional and can be possibly proven useful for R libraries that are _**not**_  available via **conda**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Templates for each of the 3 files\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **environment.yml**\n",
    "\n",
    "This file has no difference when used within a Dockerfile installation or when used natively for installing dependencies via conda. We will utilise this to create a concise Dockerfile.\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "name: my-new-env\n",
    "channels:\n",
    "  - conda-forge\n",

    "  - r-base\n",
    "  - r-devtools=2.2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. install.R**   \n",
    "_**Optional**_ but frequently useful, when dependencies are not available via conda. The file requires 2 lines that will prevent issues that come with non-interactive R installation."
