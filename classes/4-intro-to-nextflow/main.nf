// Re-usable componext for adding a helpful help message in our Nextflow script
def helpMessage() {
    log.info"""
    Usage:
    The typical command for running the pipeline is as follows:
    nextflow run main.nf --fastq_list fastq_files_list.csv
    Mandatory arguments:
      --fastq_list                  [file] A comma seperated file with all the fastq files locations
                                    A header is expected, and 3 columns that define the following:
                                    - accession number, identifier for fastq file pair
                                    - link (ftp, https) to the fastq 1
                                    - link (ftp, https) to the fastq 2
                                    
                                    A file could look like this:
                                    accession,fastq_1,fastq_2
                                    ERR908503,ftp://ERR908503_1.fastq.gz,ftp://ERR908503_2.fastq.gz
