# Mini courses
Title:
Short course on how to perform germline or somatic variant calling with nf-core/sarek
Instructors:
Christina Chatzipantsiou, Lifebit 
Anne Deslattes Mays, Science and Technology Consulting LLC
This hands-on mini course will serve as an introduction to reproducible workflows using Nextflow based pipelines for NGS analyses. The expected outcome of the short course is for the attendees to familiarise with the variant calling workflow, and be able to run locally, on Sumner and JAX CloudOS an end-to-end analyses, started from FASTQ and getting output VCF files. We assume that the attendees have basic familiarity with bash scripting and git. NOTE: An environment with all the required computational tools will be provided to the attendees of the workshop, hence there is no requirement for a personal computer with a specific OS (eg. Linux, Windows) for attending this workshop.
Mini course agenda:
a. Introduction nf-core/sarek
b. Available variant callers
c. Running an end-to-end GATK based variant calling workflow (edited)
Platform:
Learners will use Lifebit's CloudOS platform for this course. Requirements include the availability of a laptop, as they will then have the ability to log into a browser to access the course materials (Chrome preferred).
